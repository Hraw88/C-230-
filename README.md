Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? Our client, The Gaming Room, is looking to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose it. Their current game is only available on Android app. The web-based game must be capable of supporting more than one team. The game and the teams’ name must be unique, as only one game can exist in memory at any given time. Only one instance of the game can exist in the memory at any given time. 


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? While most of the project was a little rough for me, I was able to do better in my final project, in Moudle 7. I was able to better identify server side and client side requirements. I think I did pretty good in indentifying what the clients needs and requirements. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? One of the client requirements was that only one game could exist in the memory at any given time. This helped tremendously when desinging the Singleton pattern. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? Overall I would try to improve the server side aspects of my documents. I would revise the suitability of each OS to host the server side, as well as how much RAM is needed in memory management, as well as client communications with server. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? Even though the program is for the client, they are ultimately the one who use it. It's very imporant for the client to trust the developer and the software itself and to be happy with the product, or they won't use it. Authentication to verify login attempts is also important, to determine and prevent unauthorized access. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I tried to focus on the project bit by bit. By dividing the project into bits, it was easier to manage the load. In the future I would separate the game itself and then the functionalities to allow easier maintanance.
